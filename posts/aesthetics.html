                    In his writings Schopenhauer explores the experience of aesthetic contemplation. 
                    When we contemplate something aesthetically, we have knowledge of the object not as an individual thing but rather as a universal Platonic Idea (die Platonische Idee). 
                    The individual is then able to lose himself in the object of aesthetic contemplation and, for a brief moment, escape the cycle of unfulfilled desire as a 
                    "pure, will-less subject of knowledge" (reinen, willenlosen Subjekts der Erkenntniß). This entails the abandonment of the method of cognition bound to the 
                    principle of sufficient reason (the only mode appropriate to the service of the will and science). During the aesthetic experience, we gain momentary relief from 
                    the pain that accompanies our striving. Like many other aesthetic theories, Schopenhauer's centers on the concept of genius. Genius, according to Schopenhauer, is 
                    possessed by all people in varying degrees and consists of the capacity for aesthetic experience. 
                    Those who have a high degree of genius can be taught to communicate these aesthetic experiences to others, and objects that communicate these experiences are works of art.

                        We consider objects to be beautiful that best facilitate contemplation that is purely objective by a will-less consciousness and express 
                        'elevated' Ideas (such as those of humanity). Schopenhauer compares the experience of something as beautiful to the experience of something as 
                        sublime (das Erhabene)—in the latter case, we struggle over our natural hostility to the object of contemplation and are elevated above it. 
                        An aesthetic experience does not arise from the object stimulating our will; 
                        hence Schopenhauer criticized depictions of nude women and appetizing food, as these stimulate desire and thus hinder the viewer 
                        from becoming "the pure, will-less subject of knowledge."

                    Schopenhauer wrote on a variety of art forms, including architecture, landscape gardening, landscape painting, animal painting, historical painting, sculpture, the nude, literature (poetry and tragedy), and lastly, music. Music occupies a privileged place in Schopenhauer's aesthetics, as he believed it to have a special relationship to the will. Other artworks objectify the will only indirectly by means of the Ideas (the adequate objectification of the will), and our world is nothing but the appearance of the Ideas in multiplicity resulting from those Ideas entering into the principium individuationis. Music, Schopenhauer asserts, passes over the Ideas and is therefore independent of the phenomenal world. 
                    He writes:
<em>
Thus music is as immediate an objectification and copy of the whole will as the world itself is, indeed as the Ideas are, 
the multiplied phenomenon of which constitutes the world of individual things. Therefore music is by no means like the other arts, 
namely a copy of the Ideas, but a copy of the will itself, the objectivity of which are the Ideas. For this reason the effect of music is so 
very much more powerful and penetrating than is that of the other arts, for these others speak only of the shadow, but music of the essence. </em>
