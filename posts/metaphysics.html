                    Schopenhauer argues that will is the Kantian thing-in-itself: the single essence underlying all objects and phenomena.
                     Kant believed that space and time were merely the forms of our intuition by which we must perceive the world of phenomena, 
                     and these factors were absent from the thing-in-itself. Schopenhauer pointed out that anything outside of time and space could not be differentiated, 
                     so the thing-in-itself must be one. All things that exist, including human beings, must be part of this fundamental unity. The manifestation of the single 
                     will into the multiplicity of objects we experience is the will's objectivation. Plurality exists and has become possible only through time and space, which is why
                      Schopenhauer refers to them as the principium individuationis. The will, as thing-in-itself, lies outside of the principle of sufficient reason (in all its forms) and is 
                      thus groundless (though each of the will's phenomena is subject to that principle). 
                    The will, lying outside the principium individuationis, is free from all plurality (though its phenomena, existing in space and time, are innumerable).

                        All phenomena embodies essential striving: electricity and gravity, for instance, are described as fundamental forces of the will. 
                        Human capacity for cognition, Schopenhauer asserts, is subordinate to the demands of the will. Moreover, everything that wills necessarily suffers. 
                        Schopenhauer presents a pessimistic picture on which unfulfilled desires are painful, and pleasure is merely the sensation experienced 
                        at the instant one such pain is removed. However, most desires are never fulfilled, and those that are fulfilled are instantly replaced by more unfulfilled ones.
