                <p>
                    According to Schopenhauer, the task of ethics is not to prescribe moral actions that ought to be done, but to investigate moral actions. Philosophy is always theoretical: its task to explain what is given.</p>
                    <p>

                    According to Kant's transcendental idealism, space and time are forms of our sensibility in which phenomena appear in multiplicity. 
                    Reality in itself is free from multiplicity, not in the sense that an object is one, but that it is outside the possibility of multiplicity. Two individuals, though they appear distinct, are in-themselves not distinct.

                    Appearances are entirely subordinated to the principle of sufficient reason.  
                    The egoistic individual who focuses his aims on his own interests has to deal with empirical laws as well as he can.

                    What is relevant for ethics are individuals who can act against their own self-interest. If we take a man who suffers when he sees his fellow men living in poverty and consequently uses a 
                    significant 
                    part of his income to support their needs instead of his own pleasures, 
                    then the simplest way to describe this is that he makes less distinction between himself and others than is usually made.

                    Regarding how things appear to us, the egoist asserts a gap between two individuals, but the altruist experiences 
                    the sufferings of others as his own. In the same way a compassionate man cannot hurt animals, though they appear as distinct from himself.

                    What motivates the altruist is compassion. </p> The suffering of others is for him not a cold matter to 
                    which he is indifferent, but he feels connectiveness to all beings. Compassion is thus the basis of morality.

                    <b>Eternal justice</b>
                    Schopenhauer calls the principle through which multiplicity appears the principium individuationis.
                    When we behold nature we see that it is a cruel battle for existence. Individual manifestations of the will can maintain themselves only 
                    at the expense of othersâ€”the will, as the only thing that exists, has no other option but to devour itself to experience pleasure. 
                    This is a fundamental characteristic of the will, and cannot be circumvented.

                    Unlike temporal, or human justice, which requires time to repay an evil deed and, "has its seat in the state, as requiting and punishing", 
                    eternal justice "rules not the state but the world, is not dependent upon human institutions, is not subject to chance and deception, is not uncertain, 
                    wavering, and erring, but infallible, fixed, and sure."  Eternal justice is not retributive because retribution requires time. There are no delays or 
                    reprieves. Instead, punishment is tied to the offence, "to the point where the two become one."... "Tormenter and tormented are one. The [Tormenter] 
                    errs in that he believes he is not a partaker in the suffering; the [tormented], in that he believes he is not a partaker in the guilt."

                    Suffering is the moral outcome of our attachment to pleasure. Schopenhauer deemed that this truth was expressed by Christian dogma of original sin and, 
                    in Eastern religions, the dogma of rebirth.

                        <b>Quietism</b>
                        He who sees through the principium individuationis and comprehends suffering in general as his own, will see suffering everywhere, and instead of fighting for the happiness of his individual manifestation, will abhor life itself since he knows that it is inseparably connected with suffering. For him, a happy individual life in a world of suffering is like a beggar who dreams one night that he is a king.
                        
                        Those who have experienced this intuitive knowledge cannot affirm life, but exhibit asceticism and quietism, meaning that they are no longer sensitive to motives, are not concerned about their individual welfare, and accept the evil others inflict on them without resisting. They welcome poverty and do not seek or flee death. Schopenhauer referred to asceticism as the denial of the will to live.
                        
                        Human life is a ceaseless struggle for satisfaction and, instead of continuing their struggle, the ascetic breaks it. It does not matter if these ascetics adhered to the dogmata of Christianity or Dharmic religions, since their way of living is the result of intuitive knowledge.
                        
                        The Christian mystic and the teacher of the Vedanta philosophy agree in this respect also, they both regard all outward works and religious exercises as superfluous for him who has attained to perfection. So much agreement in the case of such different ages and nations is a practical proof that what is expressed here is not, as optimistic dullness likes to assert, an eccentricity and perversity of the mind, but an essential side of human nature, which only appears so rarely because of its excellence.
